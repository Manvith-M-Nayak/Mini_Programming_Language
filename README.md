# Mini_Programming_Language

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a toy programming language using Python Lex-Yacc (PLY).  
The language supports basic constructs such as `if` statements, `while` loops, `for` loops, `struct` definitions,  
and simple `function` declarations. Unlike C, the syntax is simplified and uses `end` to close blocks instead of braces.  
The lexer performs tokenization of keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators, while the parser validates grammar  
based on defined rules. This serves as an educational example of how compilers perform lexical and syntax analysis.
